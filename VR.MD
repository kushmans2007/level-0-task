# VIRTUAL REALITY
Virtual Reality (VR) is the use of computer technology to create a simulated environment. 
Virtual reality places the user inside a three-dimensional experience. Instead of viewing a screen in front of them, users are immersed in and interact with 3D worlds.   
Virtual Reality’s most immediately-recognizable component is the head-mounted display (HMD). 
## TYPES OF VIRTUAL REALITY
* Non-immersive VR :  
   Non-immersive VR technology features a computer-generated virtual environment where the user simultaneously remains aware and controlled by their physical environment. Video games are a prime example of non-immersive VR.
* Semi-Immersive Virtual Reality :  
 This type of VR provides an experience partially based in a virtual environment. This type of VR makes sense for educational and training purposes with graphical computing and large projector systems, such as flight simulators for pilot trainee   
* Fully Immersive Virtual Reality :  
 Right now, there are no completely immersive VR technologies, but advances are so swift that they may be right around the corner. This type of VR generates the most realistic simulation experience, from sight to sound to sometimes even olfactory sensations. Car racing games are an example of immersive virtual reality that gives the user the sensation of speed and driving skills. Developed for gaming and other entertainment purposes, VR use in other sectors is increasing  
 ## THE BENIFITS OF VR:
* Practical Training: VR is a safe way to simulate dangerous situations for training purposes. Firefighters, pilots, astronauts and police can learn in a controlled environment before going into the field. Immersive experience narrows timeframes so trainees can more quickly become professionals.
* Engagement and Connection: VR is an engaging and entertaining experience for its users.
* Convenient Conferences: Virtual meetings save time and money, yet help maintain a sense of collegiality.  
## Challenges of Virtual Reality
* Addiction: Some people become addicted to the VR experience in gaming and social media applications. People can assume different identifies, which can be addictive and cause social, psychological and biological issues.
* Health Problems: Extensive use of VR can create a loss of spatial awareness, nausea, dizziness, disorientation and nausea, also known as simulator sickness.
* Screen Door Effect: When you use a headset, the display is within inches of your eyes. That means you see pixels or the spaces between them, no matter how excellent the display resolution may be. This mesh-like effect can irritate some users. Newer headsets have improved but not eliminated the issue.
* Loss of Human Connections: When you rely on virtual connections rather than real-life social interactions, trouble may result. Over-reliance on VR can lead to disassociation or depression.
* Expense: While prices are coming down, VR systems are not affordable for everyone
# AUGMENTED REALITY

AR overlays video or images onto a display of the physical world, typically through a smartphone. The overlaid image creates an interaction between the user and the digital and physical worlds, allowing them to make connections or have new experiences  
## Example of augmented reality
An example of augmented reality is using an AR app to project an image of a product you want to buy from a retailer into your home, perhaps in the existing space where the item would be placed. For example, if you wanted to buy a dresser from IKEA, you could use its AR app to project the dresser in your bedroom to help you decide if it fits, matches the decor, and will work in the way you want it to.
# KEY DIFFERNCES BETWEEN AR VS VR


* AR enhances the real world by overlaying digital content—like 3D models, text, or animations—onto your physical surroundings.  You remain aware of and can interact with your real environment. This creates a partial immersion, where virtual and real elements coexist. 
* VR replaces the real world entirely with a simulated digital environment.  Once you put on a VR headset, you’re transported into a new space, achieving total immersion and disconnecting from physical reality. 
* AR can run on widely available devices like smartphones and tablets (e.g., Pokémon GO, IKEA Place), making it highly accessible.  Advanced AR also uses smart glasses like Microsoft HoloLens or Apple Vision Pro. 
* VR requires dedicated headsets such as Meta Quest, HTC Vive, or PlayStation VR, often paired with motion controllers.  These are more specialized and typically less portable.
* AR Challenges: Requires good lighting and surface recognition; privacy concerns with always-on cameras. 
* VR Challenges: Can cause motion sickness; high hardware cost; social isolation during use
